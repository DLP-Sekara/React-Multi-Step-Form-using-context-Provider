# React Multi-Step Form
## Overview
This is a React project that implements a multi-step form using a context provider.
This project demonstrates the implementation of a multi-step form in React using a context provider. It includes three form steps, each represented by a separate component (`FirstForm`, `SecondForm`, `ThirdForm`). The form data is managed using React context to maintain state across steps.

## Getting Started
   Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

1. Clone the repository:
> git clone https://github.com/DLP-Sekara/React-Multi-Step-Form-using-context-Provider

2. Navigate to the project directory:
> cd React-Multi-Step-Form-using-context-Provider

3. Install dependencies:
> npm install

3. Run the application:
> npm start

The application will be running at http://localhost:3000.


## The project structure is organized as follows:

* src/: Contains the source code.
* component/: React components.
  * FirstForm/: Component for the first step of the form.
  * SecondForm/: Component for the second step of the form.
  * ThirdForm/: Component for the third step of the form.
  * Stepper/: Component that manages the multi-step form logic.
* MultiStepContext/: Context provider for managing form state.
